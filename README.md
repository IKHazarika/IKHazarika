Hi, I am Ishan Kashyap Hazarika, a sudent of MA Economics, Delhi School of Economics.

I use and am learning R, Python, STATA, JS+CSS+HTML, Scratch, BYOB and VB. I am interested in and have been working on projects related to Economics and the behavioural sciences in general, mostly using simulations, Econometrics, Psychometrics, Causal Analysis and CGE modelling. I have also worked on experiment development and web development focusing on allowing users to engage in game theoretic experiments. On the theoretical side, I have worked on developing programs to compute equilibrium of games and general equilibrium models.

Looking forward to collaborations and suggestions!
